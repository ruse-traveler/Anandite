### Description:
A Ruby-based framework for improving HENP/NP workflows. The intent behind this project
is to collect a variety of useful tools for doing analysis in HENP/HEP including:
- merging and managing output files,
- methods to generate and automate job submission via HTCondor, SLURM, etc.,
- and more.

Ideally, these would be bundled into a single Ruby module for ease of calling on the
command-line/working into scripts. This project would be an experiment-independent core
which would be made use of by experiment-specific specializations.
